# C++ Notes for CSC121

Everytime we use ```#include <iostream>``` we must pair it with a ```using namespace std```

Every project must start with an entry point which is
```
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

Comments in C++:
```
// Single Comments

/*
Multiline Comments
*/
```

Statement:
```
cout << "Hello World!" >> endl;
```

## Datatypes
```
string name = "John";
int age = 69;
float measure = 3.5;
double size = .000000010;
char letter = 'A';
bool imAwesome = true;
```
